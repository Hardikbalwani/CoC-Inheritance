## 📝Description

Introducing NFTones, the web-based music player that leverages the power of NFTs. With NFTones, listeners can stream their favorite tracks and discover new music, all while earning NFT tokens as they listen.

In addition to mining, NFTones also features a full-featured music player, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a premium music app. Users can search for their favorite songs and artists, create playlists, discover new music, and even share their playlists with friends.

## 💸Applications

>Decentralization of Data: By storing user data and information on a decentralised network, MineTunes gives users more control over it. Users now have more control over their data, which aids in the prevention of data breaches.

>Fair Compensation for Artists: By earning NFT tokens as they listen, users are indirectly supporting the artists behind the music. This creates a new revenue stream for artists and helps ensure that they are fairly compensated for their work.

>Discovering New Music: NFTones features a full-featured music player with the ability to discover new music. This helps to promote new and emerging artists, giving them a platform to reach a wider audience.

>Monetization: 
1)NFTones can be monetized by charging users a monthly or yearly subscription fee to access the platform and its features.
2)It can also monetize through advertisements or partnerships with music industry players.
3)The platform can also earn revenue by selling NFT tokens and taking a percentage of transactions that occur on the platform.
